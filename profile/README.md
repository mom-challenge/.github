#### Contributing

If you would like to propose your own challenge, contact [raks0009](https://github.com/users/raks0009) to add the repo to the mom-challenge repos and make you maintainer.
For a challenge to be considered in a challenge year, a couple of requirements need to be satisifed:
1. There should be a designated active maintainer of the challenge repo.
2. A challenge typically consists of:
  - artefacts (possibly, and most likely in multiple formalisms)
  - descriptions of the links between these artefacts
  - the (possibly multiple) challenge scenarios - descriptions of changes, and how the changes affect other artefacts, what strategies are required by MoM solutions
3. There is a clear description of contributing guidelines and motivation for the challenge. 
4. Each challenge repo is composed of multiple branches, (named '2025', '2026', etc.), one for each year it is desired to be considered in the MoM Workshop challenge phase.
5. There is an official release of the corresponding branch within 1 month of the workshop acceptance - with DOI on Zenodo.  

If you would like to contribute to a challenge, refer to CONTRIBUTING.md in that specific challenge.

If you would like to know more about Model management, consider attending the [MoM Workshop](https://mom2025.wp.imt.fr) at the [MODELS Conference](https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2025), or contact one of its organizers or participants.
