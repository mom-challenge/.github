## Model Management (MoM) Challenges

This Github organization is aimed at collecting challenges from multiple domains describing Model Management problems.

A challenge typically consists of:
1. artefacts (possibly, and most likely in multiple formalisms)
2. descriptions of the links between these artefacts
3. the (possibly multiple) challenge scenarios - descriptions of changes, and how the changes affect other artefacts, what strategies are required by MoM solutions

The current list of Model Management challenges:

- Satellite Configuration (initiated in 2025)
  - Change Impact and Consistency
  - Unified Querying and Validation
  - Versioning
  - Generation of Views
