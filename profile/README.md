## Model Management (MoM) Challenges

This Github organization is aimed at collecting challenges from multiple domains describing Model Management problems.

A challenge typically consists of:
1. artefacts (possibly, and most likely in multiple formalisms)
2. descriptions of the links between these artefacts
3. the (possibly multiple) challenge scenarios - descriptions of changes, and how the changes affect other artefacts, what strategies are required by MoM solutions

The current list of Model Management challenges:

- [Satellite Configuration](https://github.com/mom-challenge/satellite-config) (initiated in 2025)
  - Change Impact and Consistency
  - Unified Querying and Validation
  - Versioning
  - Generation of Views


#### Contributing

If you would like to propose your own challenge, contact github user raks0009 to add the repo to the mom-challenge repos and make you admin.
For a challenge to be considered in a challenge year, a couple of requirements need to be satisifed:
1. There should be a designated active admin of the challenge repo.
2. Each challenge repo is composed of multiple branches, (named '2025', '2026', etc.), one for each year it should be considered in the MoM Workshop challenge phase .
3. There is an official release of the corresponding branch artefacts within 1 month of the workshop acceptance in that specific year - with DoI on Zenodo.

If you would like to contribute to a challenge, refer to CONTRIBUTING.md in that specific challenge.

If you would like to know more about Model management, consider attending the [MoM Workshop](https://mom2025.wp.imt.fr) at the [MODELS Conference](https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2025), or contact one of its organizers.
